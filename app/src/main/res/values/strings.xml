    <string name="rules2">
        You are playing as the Codebreaker.

        And it is your goal to guess the opponents secret code as quickly as possible.
        After you guess the secret code, the Codemaker will tell you how close your guess was to the answer.
        For this game, you put 4 letters that correspond to the colors you put in!
        G is for Green, R is for Red, U is for Blue, Y is for Yellow, W is for White, and O is for Orange.
        When you put in your answer, the computer will respond with either Black (for B), White (for W), or a Blank Space
        A Black means the color you guessed is in the right spot.
        A white means the color you guessed is in the code, but in the wrong place.
        A blank means it\'s not in the code.
        Have fun!
