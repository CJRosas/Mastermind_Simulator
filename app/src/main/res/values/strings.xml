        >Welcome to Mastermind Mobile! This is based on a board game created by Mordecai Meirowitz. \n\n
        >There are 2 players, Codemaker and Codebreaker.
        The Codemaker creates a secret 4 color code for the Codebreaker to crack. \n\n
        >There are 6 colors to choose: Red, Blue, Green, Orange, White, and Yellow.
        An example color code could be: Yellow, Red, Blue, Blue. \n\n

        you are playing as the Codebreaker. \n\n
        >It is your goal to guess the opponent\'s secret code in the least amount of guesses. \n\n
        >After each guess, the Codemaker will provide helpful feedback in the form of black and white pegs. \n\n
        >Black pegs indicate that a peg is the correct color and in the correct place in the sequence.
        White pegs indicate that a correct color is in the wrong place.
        No pegs means the color is not in the sequence. \n\n
        >For this game, you will enter 4 letters that correspond to the colors!
        G is for Green, R is for Red, U is for Blue, Y is for Yellow, W is for White, and O is for Orange.\n\n
