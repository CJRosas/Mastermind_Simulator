        Welcome to Mastermind Mobile! This is based on a board game created by Mordecai Meirowitz.
        There are 2 players, the Codemaker and the Codebreaker.
        The Codemaker creates a secret 4 peg color code for the Codebreaker to guess.
        There are 6 colors to choose: Red, Blue, Green, Orange, White, and Yellow.
        An example color code could be: Yellow, Red, Blue, Blue.

    <string name="rules2">
        you are playing as the Codebreaker.

        It is your goal to guess the opponent\'s secret code in the least amount of guesses.
        After each guess, the Codemaker will provide helpful feedback in the form of black and white pegs.
        Black pegs indicate that a peg is the correct color and in the correct place in the sequence.
        White pegs indicate that a correct color is in the wrong place.
        No pegs means the color is not in the sequence.
        For this game, you will enter 4 letters that correspond to the colors!
        G is for Green, R is for Red, U is for Blue, Y is for Yellow, W is for White, and O is for Orange.
        Good luck and have fun!
